He notes that there has been progress in increasing access to education in Pakistan, because the number of children outside the school has increased from 25 million to 22 million according to government data. However, it still remains to be done. Without compromising access to school, the emphasis should be placed on improving quality. The budgetary allocation of education now represents 3.02% of GDP, against 2.83% last year, but is still below the objective. The disadvantage of the situation is that 19% of children aged 6 to 16 remain without school. The remaining 81% that is registered in the age group of 6-16 do not learn much either. The seventh report of the Aser survey also underlined according to past trends that children enrolled in private schools work better compared to those who study in public schools. The number of children outside the school should be a source of concern for the whole nation and in particular federal and provincial governments. It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause that keeps children from schools away and forces them to do some work to help complete the income of their families. The problem can be resolved to a large extent if the number of public schools is increased significantly. Public schools charge little or no fees, but these are not enough to meet the needs of the growing population. The distance factor and the involvement of unbearable travel costs also prohibit parents from sending their children to schools. Private schools have grown in urban and rural areas and they respond to the need for medium and high income segments in society, but poor families cannot afford to admit their children in these schools. Their owners should also realize that they also have social and national obligations and offer a total percentage of admission to students of the poorest of poor families for free. There are also problems with facilities, qualifications for teaching staff and the quality of education and government should, at least, offer training facilities to all teachers, including those employed by private schools.",0
